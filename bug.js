This error typically occurs when the Expo CLI is unable to locate or access the necessary dependencies or configurations for your project. It often manifests as an inability to start the development server or build your application.  The root cause can vary;  it might involve incorrect project setup, missing or corrupted files, network connectivity issues, or problems with the Expo CLI installation itself.
